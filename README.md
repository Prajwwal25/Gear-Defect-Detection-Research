## Defect Detection Techniques
Papers and resources discussing methods for detecting defects in gears.

- **Title**: "Defect detection of gear parts in virtual manufacturing"
  - **Link**: [Paper Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10060497/#Sec6)
  - **Description**: This research proposes a deep learning network, Gear-PCNet++, for detecting gear defects using point cloud representations. The network classifies defects into four categories: fracture, pitting, glue, and wear, utilizing a novel Combinational Convolution Block (CCB) to extract local gear information. Experiments demonstrate that Gear-PCNet++ achieves better recognition results for gear defects with higher efficiency and practicability compared to other methods. The study also introduces a new 3D gear model dataset with 10,000 instances..
