## Defect Detection Techniques
Papers and resources discussing methods for detecting defects in gears.

- **Title**: "Defect detection of gear parts in virtual manufacturing"
  - **Link**: [Paper Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10060497/#Sec6)
  - **Description**: This research proposes a deep learning network, Gear-PCNet++, for detecting gear defects using point cloud representations. The network classifies defects into four categories: fracture, pitting, glue, and wear, utilizing a novel Combinational Convolution Block (CCB) to extract local gear information. Experiments demonstrate that Gear-PCNet++ achieves better recognition results for gear defects with higher efficiency and practicability compared to other methods. The study also introduces a new 3D gear model dataset with 10,000 instances..
  

## Gear Identification Methods
Resources focused on classifying different types of gears.

- **Title**: "AUTOMATIC FAULTY GEAR IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM AND ITS TYPES USING DEEP LEARNING APPROACH"
  - **Link**: [Paper Link](https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR2404G56.pdf)
  - **Description**: This paper introduces an Automatic Faulty Gear Identification System (AFGIS) that uses deep learning techniques for accurate and automated gear fault identification1. The system employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features from vibration data, enabling the detection of various gear fault types, including tooth breakage, wear, and misalignment1. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the AFGIS in accurately identifying gear faults and distinguishing between different fault types1. This facilitates proactive maintenance and enhances the reliability of mechanical systems by enabling early fault detection1. Traditional methods often rely on manual inspection or rule-based algorithms, which can be time-consuming and may lack robustness

## Tooth Counting Algorithms
Papers discussing algorithms for counting gear teeth.

- **Title**: "AI QUALITY ANALYSIS OF “SPUR GEAR” BY IMAGE PROCESSING"
  - **Link**: [Paper Link](https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIRGM06001.pdf)
  - **Description**:This project uses image processing in MATLAB to count the teeth of a spur gear. The process begins by capturing the gear image, which is then converted to grayscale. The image is thresholded to create a binary image, highlighting the gear's structure. MATLAB algorithms identify the gear's teeth by analyzing the regions of interest and applying object recognition techniques. The number of teeth is then counted based on the detected features and their spatial relationships in the image.
